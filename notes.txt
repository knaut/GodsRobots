serverside, an app needs a state

clientside, an app needs a state

serverside, we generate it from the requested url (string request)

clientside, we can retrieve it by:
		parsing the window location (same method as serverside)
		using a payload state supplied to us in the markup from the server
		asking the server for it over ajax

		in our app, option 1 is the fastest/cleanest
