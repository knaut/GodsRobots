		summary: 'Tr̊ydra is a wall-mounted, projection-mapped VJ installation. It is composed of four three-sided pyramids arranged in a downward-pointing triangle, and employs the surrounding walls as part of the projection.',
		overview: 'Concieved as a natural outgrowth of the Tetracluster, Trẙdra came about as an experiment with 3D lighting, organic effects, and wearable controllers. Fully controlled with Myo armbands via custom software, Trẙdra debuted in underground Oakland warehouses and SF nightclubs in early 2015. Its subliminal messaging is intentional, combining such arcane symbols as the Eye of Providence, the Chalice, the Vesica Pisces, and various kinds of anthropomorphism. Designed to be at once playful and monstrous, Trẙdra is a special VJ installation for unique sonic environments.',

		desc: 'The tetracluster is a ongoing, modular installation composed of three-sided pyramids. When projection-mapped, these three-sided pyramids may take on textures such as stone, brushed aluminum, bronze, or plasma. They are interactive with any number of devices and sensors such as Kinect, Leap Motion, or Myo armbands. Able to grow to fit the space it is given, the installation can be wall-mounted or, with a supporting structure, grow upwards in a freestanding fashion.',
		summary: 'Composed of three-sided pyramids in an ever-shifting pattern, the Tetracluster never appears the same way twice.',
		overview: 'Tetracluster is a projection-mapped, interactive visual installation. Textures are composed specifically for its tetrahedron-like shapes, which range in size and can be placed in any configuration. Designed to recall crystals, futuristic machinery, and organic textures like stone and moss, Tetracluster breathes and glows with the motions of whoever controls it. The installation can be controlled by Leap Motion, Myo armbands, a touch-sensitive device, or any combination thereof.',

Controllable from a tablet or Myo Armbands, Cauda Pavonis references the alchemical stage of the same name, where the prima materia goes through a rainbow of color changes.',
		summary: 'Cauda Pavonis is an alchemically themed, projection-masked fan controllable with Myo Armbands.',
		overview: 'Originally a decorative wall fan, the piece wall photographed with its original textures and then painted white. Each section of the fan is addressable, yielding upwards of 46 individual layers that can be sequenced together. Cauda Pavonis has a seemingly endless amount of patterns, color changes, and combinations. It can be controlled in real time with a tablet or Myo Armbands. If used with Myo Armbands, the 8 EMG pods on each arm directly correlates to the 16 blades of the fan, and users can see the installation shift in color with each flex of a muscle.',

		overview: 'A joint effort by k̄nautwerk, Aux Industries, and Merchants of Reality, Floatra is a unique floating sculpture, lighting installation, and art boat all in one. Designed to recall phosphorescent marine organisms, its shifting lighting patters are a unique sight. Swimmers can perch on its platform and bask in the sun. A central "moon-pool" in the center even lets visitors dip their feet in the water below. With plans that scale in size, Floatra can be built in a range of dimensions limited only by funding.',
